Question-1:
Take two lists from the user (elements of the lists separated by space) of 
the same size. The first list will contain some names and the second list 
will contain roll numbers. Your job is to assign each  name a roll number 
from the list containing numbers following the criteria given below:
Find the sum of the ASCII value of each name and then sort the names in 
descending order based on the sum. Then assign the lowest number to the 
name that has the highest ASCII value sum as a roll number.
================================================
Sample Input 1:
Alan Jack Nancy Jim
10 15 20 50

Sample Output 1:
Nancy's roll number is: 10
Alan's roll number is: 15
Jack's roll number is: 20
Jim's roll number is: 50

Explanation1: Here, the summation of the ASCII value of each name are:
Nancy(505), Alan(380), Jack(377) and Jim(288). So, Nancy got the lowest 
number (10) from the number list as roll number, then Alan got the second 
lowest (15), followed by Jack(20) and Jim (50).
================================================
Sample Input 2:
Leo Tim Kim Brad Joey
55 15 25 19 12

Sample Output 2:
Joey's roll number is: 12
Brad's roll number is: 15
Tim's roll number is: 19
Kim's roll number is: 25
Leo's roll number is: 55

Explanation2: Here, the summation of the ASCII value of each name are:
Joey(407), Brad(377), Tim(298), Kim(289) and Leo(288). So, Joey got the 
lowest number (12) from the number list as roll number, then Brad got the 
second lowest (15), followed by Tim(19), Kim(25) and Leo(55).

Question-2:
The coordinates of different persons are given in the following dictionary.

position = {'A': (2, 5), 'B': (1, 7), 'C': (9, 5), 'D': (2, 6)}

You will take 2 inputs for person X’s location where the first input 
specifies person X’s current location in the x-axis and the second input 
specifies person X’s current location in the y-axis.

Your work is to find the person closest to person X by calculating the 
distance between person X and every other person in the dictionary.

Hint: The distance between two coordinates is given by the formula (You 
need to import math):

math.sqrt((x2 - x1)**2 + (y2 - y1)**2)
================================================
Sample Input 1:
Enter person X’s x coordinate: 3
Enter person X’s y coordinate: 6

Sample Output 1:
D

Explanation 1:
X is at (3,6).
The distance between person X and person A: 2
The distance between person X and person B: 5
The distance between person X and person C: 37
The distance between person X and person D: 1

The least distance is between person X and D. So, D is selected
================================================

Sample Input 2:
Enter person X’s x coordinate: 3
Enter person X’s y coordinate: 5

Sample Output 2:
A

Explanation 1:
X is at (3,5).
The distance between person X and person A: 1
The distance between person X and person B: 22
The distance between person X and person C: 6
The distance between person X and person D: 2
The least distance is between person X and A. So, A is selected

Question-3:
Write a function name “randValues0to9” that takes a string from the user as 
an argument and generates a random integer between 0 to 9. To generate a 
random value you need a seed. As your range is 0 to 9, by doing seed%(9+1), 
you will get a random value between 0 to 9.

To generate the seed, you need to count the number of vowels and consonants 
in that argument. If the vowels are less in number than the consonants, 
then your seed will be, seed = no_of_vowels*no_of_consonants+21.
Otherwise, your seed will be, seed = no_of_vowels*no_of_consonants+57
================================================
Function Call1:
randValues0to9("H@#ello Pe3ter!!")

Sample Output1:
Vowels: 4
Consonants: 6
Seed: 45
Random value: 5

Explanation1: In “H@#ello Pe3ter!!”: string, there are 4 vowels and 6 
consonants. So the vowels are less in number than the constants and the 
seed is, seed = no_of_vowels*no_of_conostants+21 => seed = 4*6+21 = 45
As your seed is 45, your random value is 45%10 = 5

================================================
Function Call2:
randValues0to9("Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee lmao")

Sample Output2:
Vowels: 16
Consonants: 3
Seed: 105
Random value: 5

Explanation2: In “Ayeeeeeeeeeeeee lmao” string, there are 16 vowels and 3 
consonants. So the vowels are more in number than the constants and the 
seed is, seed = no_of_vowels*no_of_conostants+57 => seed = 16*3+57 = 105
As your seed is 105, your random value is 105%10 = 5
